# Liga Operator Mono Font

This font combines [Operator Mono](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/operator-mono) font and programming ligatures from [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). Inspired by [vs code: adding ligatures to a font that doesn't have them](https://stephencharlesweiss.com/vs-code-adding-ligatures-to-a-font-that-doesnt-have-them)
